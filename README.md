# MultimodalGraphRAG

A comprehensive architecture for contextually-rich Retrieval Augmented Generation using graph-based knowledge representation and multimodal content understanding.

## Features

- Advanced document processing for complex PDFs
- Semantic chunking with context preservation
- Entity and relationship extraction
- Graph-based knowledge representation
- Multimodal content understanding (text, tables, figures)
- Context-aware retrieval system

## Installation

```bash
pip install multimodal-graph-rag
```
